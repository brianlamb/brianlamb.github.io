## Features

- Responsive Design
- Blog Section

- Homepage to show off skills

## Installation

### Integrating into your site

To install this theme, first create a themes folder in your site with

```bash
mkdir themes
```

Then move into this directory with

```bash
cd themes
```

The repository can then be added either by cloning or adding as a submodule

```bash
# Cloning
git clone https://github.com/samrobbins85/hugo-developer-portfolio hugo-developer-portfolio
# Submodule
git submodule add https://github.com/samrobbins85/hugo-developer-portfolio hugo-developer-portfolio
```

In the `config.toml` file in your site directory add

```toml
theme="hugo-developer-portfolio"
```

### Creating a new site

If you just want to get set up with a new site, you can start from the Example Site I have provided. To do this:

1. Cut the `exampleSite` folder out of the theme and paste it wherever you want
2. Create a `theme` directory within the `exampleSite folder`
3. Paste the theme into this directory, ensuring is has the name `hugo-developer-portfolio`

## Configuration

This is a highly configurable site, and as such, it will be unlikely that it will work with your existing site.

### `Config.toml`

`Config.toml` provides the basic structure of the site, it contains a range of sections

#### Base information

In the example site, the base information looks as follows

```toml
baseURL = "http://example.com" # The URL of your site
languageCode = "en-gb" # The language you want to display the site in
title = "Sam Robbins" # The title you want to appear in the address bar
theme = "hugo-developer-portfolio" # The theme, don't change this
```

#### Plugins

These are the essential plugins required to run the site, but you can add more if you need

```toml
[params.plugins]
  # CSS Plugins
  [[params.plugins.css]]
  URL = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/uikit@3.2.6/dist/css/uikit.min.css"
  # JS Plugins
  [[params.plugins.js]]
  URL = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/uikit@3.2.6/dist/js/uikit.min.js"
  [[params.plugins.js]]
  URL = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/uikit@3.2.6/dist/js/uikit-icons.min.js"
```

#### Navigation

This specifies the titles for the entries in the taskbar. `name` can be changed to show a different name. `URL` should not be changed in most situations as the pages will exist at the old URLs rather than the new ones, so this will result in dead links.

```toml
# navigation
[menu]
  [[menu.main]]
  name = "About"
  URL = "about"
  [[menu.main]]
  name = "Blog"
  URL = "blog"
  [[menu.main]]
  name = "Portfolio"
  URL = "portfolio"
  [[menu.main]]
  name = "Contact"
  URL = "contact"
```

#### Params

This contains the other configuration information

```toml
[params]
home = "Home" # What you want the homepage to show up as in the menu bar
# Meta data
description = "The website of Sam Robbins, 2nd Year Computer Science Student at Durham University"
author = "Sam Robbins"


  [params.contact]
  formAction = "https://formspree.io/<Insert code>" # Add your formspree URL here to get emails

  # This contains the contact information for the footer
  [params.footer]
  email = "samrobbinsgb@gmail.com"
  address = "Durham, UK"
  googlemaps = "https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?q=place_id:ChIJwbHYJaUqfEgRK0Ui9dVGimc&key=AIzaSyAE_4rVAKux_DSPcb_OdSRDaovtPOSk_3U"
```

### `homepage.yml`

This file is stored in `data/homepage.yml`. It determines the content of the homepage and contains many sections

#### banner

```yml
banner:
  title: Hi! Iâ€™m Sam
```
